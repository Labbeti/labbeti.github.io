I hold a PhD in Computer Science, with a primary research focus on artificial intelligence applied to audio analysis and natural language processing. My [doctoral dissertation](http://thesesups.ups-tlse.fr/6084/1/2024TLSES054.pdf) concentrated on Automated Audio Captioning, a multimodal task aimed at developing systems capable of generating natural language sentences to describe audio files.

I am currently working on the **TIRIS-SILENCE** project, which aims to study and extract information from audio files recorded in extreme environments such as Mars.

<!-- PhD in computer science, mainly focused on deep learning methods for audio analysis and natural language processing. My thesis was focused on **Automated Audio Captioning**, a multimodal task aiming to build systems able of describing an audio file using a sentence written in natural language. -->

<!-- I'm a PhD student currently working on Artificial Intelligence for computational analysis of audio events using deep learning methods.

<!-- During my PhD, I have worked a lot with recent deep learning approaches, treated crossmodal data and worked on several supercomputers like [Jean Zay](https://www.cnrs.fr/en/press/jean-zay-frances-most-powerful-supercomputer-research). In a few months, I'm going to finish my PhD thesis, but I'd like to continue participating in the development of AI to help improve society. -->
