Most current methods utilize pre-trained analysis models to extract relevant semantic content from the audio input. However, prior information on language modeling is rarely introduced, and corresponding architectures are limited in capacity due to data scarcity. In this paper, we present a method leveraging the linguistic information contained in BART, a large-scale conditional language model with general purpose pre-training. The caption generation is conditioned on sequences of textual AudioSet tags. This input is enriched with temporally aligned audio embeddings that allows the model to improve the sound event recognition. The full BART architecture is fine-tuned with few additional parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that, beyond the scaling properties of the architecture, language-only pre-training improves the text quality in the multimodal setting of audio captioning. The best model achieves state-of-the-art performance on AudioCaps with 46.5 SPIDEr.}, doi. = {10.5281/zenodo.5770113}

Our approach employs an encoder-decoder architecture, with the encoder utilizing a large contrastive pre-trained HTS-AT capable of handling variable-length audio segments. The decoder is based on the GPT2 model. To incorporate audio into the decoding process, we employ a light mapping network that translates audio representations into a prefix, effectively guiding the decoder\u2019s generation process. Given the limited data availability, we pre-train our model on various audio captioning datasets and fine-tune it on Clotho.

{Automated audio captioning is the multimodal task of describing environmental audio recordings with fluent natural language. Most current methods utilize pre-trained analysis models to extract relevant semantic content from the audio input. However, prior information on language modeling is rarely introduced, and corresponding architectures are limited in capacity due to data scarcity. In this paper, we present a method leveraging the linguistic information contained in BART, a large-scale conditional language model with general purpose pre-training. The caption generation is conditioned on sequences of textual AudioSet tags. This input is enriched with temporally aligned audio embeddings that allows the model to improve the sound event recognition. The full BART architecture is fine-tuned with few additional parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that, beyond the scaling properties of the architecture, language-only pre-training improves the text quality in the multimodal setting of audio captioning. The best model achieves state-of-the-art performance on AudioCaps with 46.5 SPIDEr.}, doi. = {10.5281/zenodo.5770113}

Our approach employs an encoder-decoder architecture, with the encoder utilizing a large contrastive pre-trained HTS-AT capable of handling variable-length audio segments. The decoder is based on the GPT2 model. To incorporate audio into the decoding process, we employ a light mapping network that translates audio representations into a prefix, effectively guiding the decoder\u2019s generation process. Given the limited data availability, we pre-train our model on various audio captioning datasets and fine-tune it on Clotho.

Our approach employs an encoder-decoder architecture, with the encoder utilizing a large contrastive pre-trained HTS-AT capable of handling variable-length audio segments. The decoder is based on the GPT2 model. To incorporate audio into the decoding process, we employ a light mapping network that translates audio representations into a prefix, effectively guiding the decoder\u2019s generation process. Given the limited data availability, we pre-train our model on various audio captioning datasets and fine-tune it on Clotho.

The decoder is based on the GPT2 model. To incorporate audio into the decoding process, we employ a light mapping network that translates audio representations into a prefix, effectively guiding the decoder\u2019s generation process.

We simultaneously solve the main caption generation and sub indeterminacy problems by estimating keywords and sentence length through multi-task learning. We tested a simplified model of our submission using the development-testing dataset. Our model achieved 20.7 SPIDEr score where that of the baseline system was 5.4.} }","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","@techreport{schaumloeffel2023_t6a, title = {PEACS: Prefix encoding for auditory caption synthesis}, author = {Schauml\u00f6ffel, Timothy and Vilas, Martina G. and Roig, Gemma}, year = 2023, month = {May}, institution = {DCASE2023 Challenge}, abstract = {This technical report describes an Automated Audio Captioning system for the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2023 Challenge, Task 6a (automated audio captioning). Our approach employs an encoder-decoder architecture, with the encoder utilizing a large contrastive pre-trained HTS-AT capable of handling variable-length audio segments. The decoder is based on the GPT2 model. To incorporate audio into the decoding process, we employ a light mapping network that translates audio representations into a prefix, effectively guiding the decoder\u2019s generation process. Given the limited data availability, we pre-train our model on various audio captioning datasets and fine-tune it on Clotho. We reach a SPIDERr-FL score of 29.3 on the evaluation split of the Clotho-v2 dataset.} }","","","","","","","@techreport{kicinski2022_t6a, title = {Exploring audio captioning with keyword-guided text generation}, author = {Kicinski, Dawid and de Gail, Teodor Lamort and Bujnowski, Pawel}, year = 2022, month = {July}, institution = {DCASE2022 Challenge}, abstract = {This technical report describes our submission to the DCASE 2022 challenge, Task 6 A: automated audio captioning.

Our approach employs an encoder-decoder architecture, with the encoder utilizing a large contrastive pre-trained HTS-AT capable of handling variable-length audio segments. The decoder is based on the GPT2 model. To incorporate audio into the decoding process, we employ a light mapping network that translates audio representations into a prefix, effectively guiding the decoder\u2019s generation process. Given the limited data availability, we pre-train our model on various audio captioning datasets and fine-tune it on Clotho. We reach a SPIDERr-FL score of 29.3 on the evaluation split of the Clotho-v2 dataset.} }","","","","","","","@techreport{kicinski2022_t6a, title = {Exploring audio captioning with keyword-guided text generation}, author = {Kicinski, Dawid and de Gail, Teodor Lamort and Bujnowski, Pawel}, year = 2022, month = {July}, institution = {DCASE2022 Challenge}, abstract = {This technical report describes our submission to the DCASE 2022 challenge, Task 6 A: automated audio captioning.

Our approach employs an encoder-decoder architecture, with the encoder utilizing a large contrastive pre-trained HTS-AT capable of handling variable-length audio segments. The decoder is based on the GPT2 model. To incorporate audio into the decoding process, we employ a light mapping network that translates audio representations into a prefix, effectively guiding the decoder\u2019s generation process. Given the limited data availability, we pre-train our model on various audio captioning datasets and fine-tune it on Clotho. We reach a SPIDERr-FL score of 29.3 on the evaluation split of the Clotho-v2 dataset.} }","","","","","","","@techreport{kicinski2022_t6a, title = {Exploring audio captioning with keyword-guided text generation}, author = {Kicinski, Dawid and de Gail, Teodor Lamort and Bujnowski, Pawel}, year = 2022, month = {July}, institution = {DCASE2022 Challenge}, abstract = {This technical report describes our submission to the DCASE 2022 challenge, Task 6 A: automated audio captioning.
